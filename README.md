# Patch-based Image inpainting
Patch-based Image inpainting is a powerful image restoration program that uses advanced algorithms to effectively restore images with missing or damaged areas. The program is designed to analyze the surrounding areas of the missing/damaged regions and fill them in with similar image patches, resulting in highly accurate restorations that preserve the original image quality and detail.
